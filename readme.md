readMe - MANGASTORE

### What it is
It is a simple e-commerce site where you can purchase manga/comics.

### UX

**The project’s target audience**: The target audience is people who enjoy reading manga and would like to purchase volumes of manga online.
**What my target audience wants to achieve**: The goal of the target audience would be to purchase manga online.
**How my project will help the audience achieve their goals**: This site helps the target audience to achieve their goals by giving them a simple and straight-forward way to purchase manga online.
**The Font/Aesthetic**: The choice to go with the ‘Bangers’ font from Google fonts was deliberate. The idea was to bring a comic book feel and aesthetic to the site, hence, the playful, comic-book like font and bright colours and highlights when hovering on the nav-bar elements. However, the Open Sans font from Google Fonts was used in forms for legibility purposes.
